### **MACHINE LEARNING**



* **Ml is a subset of AI**



* **There are three types of Machine learning** 



###### **1.Supervised learning:**

  **train on the labelled dataset** 

###### 

###### **2.Unsupervised learning:**

   **train on the unlabelled dataset and identify patterns itself**



###### **3.Reinforcement learning:**

   **interacts with environoment and learn from them based on rewards**



* **Supervised learning algorithms are again categorized into two types:**



	**1. classification: goal is to predict discrete labels, works on 	categorical data**



	**2. Regression : to predict continuous numerial values , works on 	numerical data**

### 

### **Model**



* **Mathematical representation of the relationship between input data(features) and output data(labels)**



#### **Components of a model**



###### **1.parameters:**



* **values learned during the training, they change automatically when the model sees data**



###### 

###### **2.Hyperparameters:**



* **values set before the training, the model does not learn them, we choose them**



###### **3.Model Structure:**



* **defines how inputs are combined**



#### **How does a model learn?**



* **learns by adjusting its parameters based on the training data**
* **bad prediction - adjust parameters**
* **better prediction - keep adjusting**
* **finally - model learns the best parameters**





**problem Framing -> data collection and preparation -> data splitting (Train/Test) ->  modelling(Train) -> evaluation(Test)-> Deployment**
